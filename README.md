# Shay Howe Site Practice (100Devs '22 Cohort)

This code-along project was completed as a review of basic HTML & CSS.

Newer styling techniques such as flexbox and grid were excluded to practice the older layout styles with floats.

The project spanned 12 lessons to practice many HTML tags and CSS styling techniques.

I encourage anyone learning web development to complete the project/lessons on Shay Howe's as it is very dense and to the point!
Each lesson builds to a this conference site throughout so much of what is learned is immediately put into practice in a real static site.
